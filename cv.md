## About me :

For a long time, I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. I have been involved in sports all my life, I thought that in the future I would become a coach and would transfer my knowledge to people. But at the end of the first year of university, due to health problems, I quit sports. And then, at one of the computer science classes, the teacher offered to go to his __web design lessons__. I thought why not, because there wasn't much that interested me at the time. I came to him every day after classes and pretty quickly went through the material that he could give me. Then I began to immerse myself in this area. I think that my perseverance and hard work will help me become a __Senior Front End Developer__.
